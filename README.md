# Interactive Graph for Material for MkDocs
Plugin for Material for MkDocs to draw an interactive graph like Obsidian.
The graph inside the sidebar is just available for non-mobile website. The modal view via the button next to the light/dark mode switch shall work on all devices.

Refer [Github Pages](https://daxcore.github.io/mkdocs-obsidian-interactive-graph-plugin/) for a **demonstration** of the interactive graph in Material for MkDocs.

# Installation
Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-obsidian-interactive-graph-plugin/).
Install via `pip install mkdocs-obsidian-interactive-graph-plugin` or add it to your `requirements.txt`.

# Usage
## Setup in MkDocs
Activate the plugin in `mkdocs.yml`, but **note** that this plugin has to be located before plugins, that replace wikilinks by markdown links. Currently just wikilinks like `[[Link#Anchor|Custom Text]]` are supported.
```
plugins:
  - obsidian-interactive-graph

extra_javascript:
  - https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js
  - https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/echarts/dist/echarts.min.js
  - assets/javascripts/interactive_graph.js

extra_css:
  - assets/stylesheets/interactive_graph.css
```

## Graph Javascript by Apache ECharts
A `interactive_graph.js` example can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daxcore/mkdocs-obsidian-interactive-graph-plugin/main/docs/ObsidianVault/assets/javascripts/interactive_graph.js) and must be located into the docs directory under `docs/YourSiteName/assets/javascripts/interactive_graph.js`.

Beginning from version `0.3.0` the default graph inside the sidebar was minimized to edges related to the current page only. The previous behavior can be restored by setting `global` to `true` at line `draw_graph_sidebar(myChart, global=false)` at top of javascript file.

# Docker
Adapt the `.env` and `mkdocs.yml` files to your needs. `DEV=ON` will rebuild the `mkdocs-obsidian-interactive-graph-plugin` from local files. If `DEV != ON` the upstream packages of PyPI will be used. Build and start the Docker container via `docker compose up --build [-d]`.

# Limitations
There is a bug in ECharts library in pinch to zoom feature (https://github.com/apache/echarts/pull/21068), but it seems like they will not fix it. Anybody can fix it by its own, by downloading the current version of the javascript library and patching via diff of the pull-request and use this in the mkdocs configuration. May another good idea could be, to not use the ECharts library... There is another project like this, that uses D3 library instead of ECharts: https://github.com/develmusa/mkdocs-network-graph-plugin including some more improvements.
